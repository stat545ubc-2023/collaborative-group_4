## What is the project?
This is a repository that contains all files and code related to our **UBC STAT 545A Collaborative Project**. The group members are Nicola Rammell, Jonas Stettner, Linnan Zhou, Renessa Gomes, Christine Chuong, and Vincent Halim. Together, we are working on this project as outlined in the UBC STAT 545 course instructions, divided into [Milestone 1](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/collaborative-project/milestone1/) and [Milestone 2](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/collaborative-project/milestone2/). Briefly, the project involves team members working together on a public repository where our contributions to all files are completed using GitHub branches and the git + GitHub workflow, making our work fully collaborative and reproducible!

## What are the files?
The files in this repository consist of a TEAMWORK file, which outlines our team contract for the division of labour that we will follow for this project, and of troubleshooting files, which contain code that we are collaboratively troubleshooting. The final debugged versions of the troubleshooting exercises can also be found as markdown files in our repository. The first of these troubleshooting files (troubleshooting-1) was completed for Milestone 1 by Nicola Rammell, Jonas Stettner, Linnan Zhou and Renessa Gomes. The second of these troubleshooting files (troubleshooting-2) was completed for Milestone 2 by Nicola Rammell, Jonas Stettner, Renessa Gomes, Christine Chuong, and Vincent Halim. 

## How can you run our code?

Our code can be run by following these instructions:
1. Clone the repo by running:
```
git clone git@github.com:stat545ubc-2023/collaborative-group_4.git
```
2. Open troubleshooting .Rmd files and run them using R/RStudio.
