# Teamwork Contract

## Division of Labour

Each team member will work on their assigned tasks individually. This approach ensures that the work in each teammate's pull request is clearly identified and can be reviewed effectively.

## Timing
**Deadlines**: We will establish specific deadlines for each milestone and communicate them to the team using the appropriate communication platforms listed below.

**Pull Request Submission**: Every team member will strive to submit their pull request at least _24 hours before the deadline_. This time frame allows sufficient time for another teammate to review and provide feedback on the work.

**Debugging and Error Fixing**: We will allocate time after pull request submission to address any issues or bugs identified during the review process. It is crucial to avoid last-minute submissions.

## Communication
**Tools**: Slack will serve as our real-time communication channel, while GitHub will be used for tracking and discussing project-related subjects.

**Slack Usage**: Slack will primarily be utilized for quick queries, updates, and general discussions.

**GitHub Usage**: GitHub Pull Requests are the place where we talk about suggested code changes. Following guidelines apply:
    - Before merging a PR, the responsible person makes sure to read through all comments to ensure this PR is ready to be merged.
    - The person who created the branch is the only one who can delete the branch.

**Regular Meetings**: As of Milestone 1, no regular meetings have been scheduled as tasks were virtually assigned, suggested deadlines were established and tasks were completely individually. This is may change given the nature of future components of the project. 

This teamwork contract is a living document that can be revised or updated as needed throughout the project. It is vital for all team members to adhere to these guidelines to ensure effective collaboration and the successful completion of the milestone.
